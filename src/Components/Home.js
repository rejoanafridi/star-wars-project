					The Star Wars series has spawned multiple live-action
					and animated films. The series started with a film trilogy set in
					medias res—beginning in the middle of the story—which was later
					expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, better known as the "Skywalker
					saga". The original trilogy was released between 1977 and 1983, the
					prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy between
					2015 and 2019. The original eponymous film, later subtitled Episode IV
					– A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V – The Empire
					Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983),
					forming what is collectively referred to as the original trilogy.
					Years later, a prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Episode I –
					The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002),
					and Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). After Lucasfilm was sold
					to Disney, a sequel trilogy began with Episode VII – The Force Awakens
					(2015), continued with Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017), and
					concluded with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).[1] In
					between the sequel films, two anthology films were released, Rogue
					One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both
					set between the prequel and original trilogies. The combined box
					office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion,[2] and it
					is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise.[3] All the
					major theatrical live-action films were nominated for Academy Awards.
					The original film was nominated for most of the major categories,
					including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and
					Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness, while all sequels have been
					nominated for technical categories.
